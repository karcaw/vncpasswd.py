Python Installation:
-------------------

This python script was built with and only supports Python 2! If you are from the future, or accessing this via the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault 02/02/2020][5], First of all... congratulations on surviving!  If this code is useful to you, you may need to obtain a version of Python 2.7.  Alternatively, you may use the Python `2to3` utility to convert this source code for use with Python 3 (may take some testing & development to get working on all platforms).

To install Python 2.7.17 (Latest version as of 01/28/2020. Python 2 End of Life was 01/01/2020):

### macOS / Linux:
If your system does not have an available `python2` in `PATH` linked:

    # Make sure you have build dependencies installed on your platform:
    # For example: GNU make, gcc / g++ compiler, build-essential package, etc...
    # Find and/or download Python 2.7
    curl -L -o /tmp/python-v2.7.17.tar.gz https://github.com/python/cpython/archive/v2.7.17.tar.gz
    tar -xvf /tmp/python-v2.7.17.tar.gz
    cd cpython-2.7.17/
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
    # OR: sudo make altinstall
    
    # Symlink `python2` to the resulting python2.7 binary
    # For example:
    ln -sf /usr/local/bin/python2.7 /usr/local/bin/python2

Alternatively, use [`pyenv`][8]:

- If on macOS, Homebrew method is preferred:

        brew install pyenv

- Otherwise, install via [`pyenv-installer`][9] script & restart your shell:

        curl -L https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer/raw/master/bin/pyenv-installer | bash
        exec $SHELL

- Build & Compile Python 2.7

        pyenv install 2.7.17

- Use `pyenv` in a shell with:

        eval "$(pyenv init - )"


### Windows:

To install Python and get familiar with Visual Studio's Python development
tools on Windows platforms, refer to [Getting Started with Python in VS Code][10].
The official [Python Downloads][11] page should have `.msi` installers available
for your Windows platform: (`x86-64 MSI installer`, `x86 MSI installer`).

#### Building cPython

Building cPython on Windows, is a more advanced topic that is out of scope for
this guide.
Please refer to the [`python/cpython/PCbuild/readme.txt`][6] for
Windows-specific build instructions (Microsoft Visual Studio 2017).
The basic idea is to make sure you have build & compilation dependencies
installed for Windows platform, and run the `build.bat` script.

Excerpt:

> Building Python using the build.bat script
> ----------------------------------------------
> 
> In this directory you can find build.bat, a script designed to make
> building Python on Windows simpler.  This script will use the env.bat
> script to detect either Visual Studio 2017 or 2015, either of
> which may be used to build Python. Currently Visual Studio 2017 is
> officially supported.
> 
> By default, build.bat will build Python in Release configuration for
> the 32-bit Win32 platform.  It accepts several arguments to change
> this behavior, try `build.bat -h` to learn more.

More modern versions of VS Code have Extensions for Python and CMake support.
You may wish to refer to [Getting Started with Python in VS Code][10].
In addition, Windows Subsystem for Linux may allow you to run, and build this
project using native Linux tools.  Again, this is beyond the scope of this
guide because it is assumed that you know how to use these tools if you need
them.

Installation:
-------------

This project installs from source via:

    git clone https://github.com/trinitronx/vncpasswd.py.git vncpasswd.py
    cd vncpasswd.py
    python2 ./vncpasswd.py --help

Note: The "shebang" line at the top of the python script is: `#!/usr/bin/env python2`

If you have `python2`, and `/usr/bin/env` binaries available in your system's `PATH`, you should be all set up to just run the executable script file as-is: `./vncpasswd.py`

On Windows, this command will work in PowerShell.  However, it will open a
`cmd.exe` window and close it too quickly to see any output.  If you require an
interactive terminal experience, run with `python.exe`.  For example

    python.exe .\vncpasswd.py --help

To build a Docker image, or Python Source Distribution, see below or run `make help` to see all available `Makefile` targets.

Usage:
------

The `help` output explains the command line flags:

> usage: vncpasswd.py [-h] [-d] [-e] [-H] [-R] [-f FILENAME] [-t] [passwd]
> 
> Encrypt or Decrypt a VNC password
> 
> positional arguments:
>   passwd                A password to encrypt
> 
> optional arguments:
>
>   -h, --help            show this help message and exit
>
>   -d, --decrypt         Decrypt an obfuscated password.
>
>   -e, --encrypt         Encrypt a plaintext password. (default mode)
>
>   -H, --hex             Assume input is in hex.
>
>   -R, --registry        Input or Output to the windows registry.
>
>   -f FILENAME, --file FILENAME
>
>                         Input or Output to a specified file.
>
>   -t, --test            Run the unit tests for this program.

### Docker:

The docker container is ready-built with all dependencies needed.  Just mount in your file (e.g.: `-v $HOME/.vnc/:$HOME/.vnc`, or just `-v $HOME:$HOME`), and run:

    # Decrypt ~/.vnc/passwd
    docker run -ti -v $HOME:$HOME -w $HOME  trinitronx/vncpasswd.py -d -f ~/.vnc/passwd
    
    # More Examples:
    # Encrypt string 'foo'
    docker run  -v $HOME:$HOME -w $HOME -ti trinitronx/vncpasswd.py -e 'foo'
    # Encrypt string 'bar' and output to ~/.vnc/passwd
    mkdir -p $HOME/.vnc/
    docker run  -v $HOME:$HOME -w $HOME -ti trinitronx/vncpasswd.py -e 'foo' -f ~/.vnc/passwd
    # Encrypt string 'bar' as HEX input
    docker run  -v $HOME:$HOME -w $HOME -ti trinitronx/vncpasswd.py -e -H '6261720000000000'
    # Decrypt the encrypted password 'bar' as HEX input
    docker run  -v $HOME:$HOME -w $HOME -ti trinitronx/vncpasswd.py -d -H '9ca3f3686574f277'
